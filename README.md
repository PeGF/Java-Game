This project is being developed for the Object-Oriented Computing course, part of the Information Systems program at the University of SÃ£o Paulo. Although the current codebase is functional, it was not developed following good object-oriented principles. 
The existing code is written in Java but follows a procedural programming style and contains significant redundancy. This project aims to improve the code by applying object-oriented principles and best practices.
In addition to the code rewrite, several new features will be implemented:

New Enemy Type:
A new enemy type with different attack and movement behaviors.

Power-Up:
A power-up item that, when collected, improves some aspect of the player's ship.

Player Health Points:
A health points system for the player.
The player should have a certain number of health points (defined via command line).
Health points should decrease by 1 unit when hit by a projectile or enemy.
The player's ship should only explode when health points reach zero.

By focusing on these improvements and additional features, the codebase will become more maintainable, extensible, and aligned with object-oriented design principles.
